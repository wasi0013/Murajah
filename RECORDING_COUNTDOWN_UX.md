# Recording Countdown UX Improvement üéôÔ∏è

## Overview
Added a professional 3-second countdown before recording starts, with the Quran page staying blurred throughout the entire recording session for focus and distraction-free recording experience.

## Features Implemented

### 1. **3-Second Countdown Timer**
- When the user clicks the "Record" button, a countdown overlay appears
- Displays: **3 ‚Üí 2 ‚Üí 1 ‚Üí üé§** (microphone emoji shows when recording starts)
- Full-screen overlay with semi-transparent black background
- Large, pulsing countdown numbers for clear visibility

### 2. **Quran Page Blur Effect**
- The Quran text section (`#quran-text-section`) is blurred during:
  - The 3-second countdown
  - The entire recording session
- Blur effect is removed immediately when:
  - User clicks "Stop" button
  - User clicks "Cancel" button
  - Recording completes successfully

### 3. **Enhanced User Feedback**
- Clear visual indication that recording is about to start
- Prevents accidental interaction with the Quran text during recording
- Professional, distraction-free environment
- Smooth animations and transitions

## Technical Implementation

### CSS Changes
```css
/* Recording Countdown Overlay */
.recording-countdown-overlay {
  position: fixed;
  inset: 0;
  background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5);
  display: flex;
  align-items: center;
  justify-content: center;
  z-index: 40;
  animation: fadeIn 0.3s ease-out;
}

.countdown-timer {
  font-size: 6rem;
  font-weight: bold;
  color: white;
  text-align: center;
  animation: countdownPulse 0.6s ease-in-out;
}

@keyframes countdownPulse {
  0% {
    transform: scale(1);
    opacity: 1;
  }
  50% {
    transform: scale(1.1);
  }
  100% {
    transform: scale(1);
    opacity: 1;
  }
}

/* Blur effect for Quran text section during recording */
#quran-text-section.blur-recording {
  filter: blur(8px);
  pointer-events: none;
}
```

### Vue.js Reactive State
```javascript
// Recording countdown state
const recordingCountdown = ref(null); // null, 3, 2, 1, 0 = recording started
let countdownTimer = null;
```

### Modified Functions

#### `startRecording()`
- Initiates countdown instead of immediate recording
- Displays 3-second countdown overlay
- Blurs the Quran text section
- Starts actual recording after countdown completes
- Includes error handling to remove blur on failure

#### `stopRecording()`
- Removes blur effect immediately when recording stops
- Saves the recording with all metadata
- Clears timers and resets state

#### `cancelRecording()`
- Clears countdown timer if in countdown phase
- Clears recording timer if recording was in progress
- Removes blur effect immediately
- Provides user feedback that recording was cancelled

### Template Changes
```html
<!-- Recording Countdown Overlay -->
<div v-if="recordingCountdown !== null" class="recording-countdown-overlay">
  <div class="countdown-timer">
    {{ recordingCountdown > 0 ? recordingCountdown : 'üé§' }}
  </div>
</div>
```
