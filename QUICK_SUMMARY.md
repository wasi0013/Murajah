# QUICK SUMMARY: Font Fix & Missing Features

## ✅ Font Rendering - FIXED!

**Issue Found**: CSS wasn't applying the QPCV2Page font to text elements

**Fixes Applied**:
1. Added 'QPCV2Page' to font-family in .quran-text CSS (line 51)
2. Fixed font paths from `/resources/` to `./resources/` (lines 801, 803)

**Test It**: Open beta-full.html - Quran text should now display in proper Arabic font!

## 🔍 KEY INSIGHTS

### What's Working Well
- ✅ Vue 3 structure is clean and scalable
- ✅ State management with stores is good
- ✅ Data loading is efficient (lazy loading)
- ✅ UI framework (Tailwind) looks polished

## 💡 IMPLEMENTATION STRATEGY

**Option A: Quick Path** (12-15 hours)
- Fix only critical features
- Get to MVP (Minimum Viable Product)
- Then add polish

**Option B: Complete Parity** (25-35 hours)  
- Implement all 50+ features
- Match index.html 100%
- Full feature set

**Recommendation**: Start with Option A, then continue with Option B

## 📞 QUESTIONS TO CONSIDER

1. Should we keep Vue 3 rewrite or go back to index.html?
   - Vue 3 is more maintainable long-term
   - index.html works but harder to maintain

2. What's the priority - speed or features?
   - Speed: 3-5 days to MVP
   - Complete: 1-2 weeks for full feature parity

3. Which features are most important?
   - Suggest: Word-by-word → Perfect revisions → Mistake tracking
