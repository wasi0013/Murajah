#### ✅ **Computed Properties**

```javascript
// Core calculation tests
completedDays
  ✓ Counts days where all selected tasks completed
  ✓ Checks both todayGoal and goalHistory
  ✓ Returns 0 when no completed days

totalDays
  ✓ Counts all tracked days including today
  ✓ Returns goalHistory.length + (1 if todayGoal exists, 0 otherwise)
  ✓ Returns 0 on first day

completionRate
  ✓ Calculates percentage: (completedDays / totalDays) * 100
  ✓ Returns 0 when totalDays is 0
  ✓ Rounds to nearest integer

streakMessage
  ✓ "Start your streak today!" when streak = 0
  ✓ "1 day strong" when streak = 1
  ✓ "X days going" when streak < 7
  ✓ "X weeks strong" when streak >= 7 and < 30
  ✓ "X months strong" when streak >= 30

completePercentage
  ✓ Same as completionRate
  ✓ Calculates (completedDays / totalDays) * 100

partialDays
  ✓ Counts days where some (but not all) tasks completed
  ✓ Filters from goalHistory only
  ✓ Returns 0 when no partial days

partialPercentage
  ✓ Calculates (partialDays / totalDays) * 100
  ✓ Accounts for partial completions

nonePercentage
  ✓ Calculates 100 - completePercentage - partialPercentage
  ✓ Fills remaining percentage

last30DaysTrend
  ✓ Returns array of 30 status values
  ✓ Ends with today's date
  ✓ Starts 29 days before today
  ✓ Each value is 'complete', 'partial', or 'none'
  ✓ Checks todayGoal for today's date
  ✓ Checks goalHistory for past dates

recentActivity
  ✓ Returns last 5 activities from last 7 days
  ✓ Each activity has text, date, icon, color
  ✓ Shows "Today" for today's date
  ✓ Shows "Yesterday" for yesterday's date
  ✓ Uses YYYY-MM-DD format for other dates
  ✓ Color-coded: green for complete, yellow for partial

getTrendDayTooltip
  ✓ Takes (index, status) as parameters
  ✓ Calculates date from index (29-index days back)
  ✓ Returns formatted "MMM D: status" string
  ✓ Works correctly for all 30 days
```

#### ✅ **Data Integration**

```javascript
// dailyGoalsStore Integration
✓ completedDays uses dailyGoalsStore.goalHistory
✓ completedDays uses dailyGoalsStore.selectedTasks
✓ totalDays uses dailyGoalsStore.todayGoal
✓ streakMessage uses dailyGoalsStore.streak
✓ All metrics update reactively when store changes

// Reactive Updates
✓ Completion rate updates when task completed
✓ Streak updates when new day started
✓ Activity log updates with new entries
✓ Trend chart updates daily
```

#### ✅ **UI/UX Tests**

1. **Dark Mode Support**
   - [x] Cards use `dark:bg-gray-800` backgrounds
   - [x] Text uses `dark:text-white` colors
   - [x] Borders use `dark:border-gray-700`
   - [x] Icons use colored text (not affected by dark mode bg)
   - [x] Gradient backgrounds convert to solid colors in dark mode

2. **Responsive Design**
   - [x] Stats grid: `grid-cols-1 sm:grid-cols-2 lg:grid-cols-4` (1 col mobile, 2 col tablet, 4 col desktop)
   - [x] Charts section: `grid-cols-1 lg:grid-cols-2` (stacked mobile, side-by-side desktop)
   - [x] Bar chart bars scale properly on mobile
   - [x] Circular representation centers properly
   - [x] Activity log scrolls on small screens

3. **Accessibility**
   - [x] Semantic HTML (sections, heading hierarchy)
   - [x] Icons paired with text labels
   - [x] Color not the only indicator (text labels included)
   - [x] Sufficient contrast ratios
   - [x] Hover states clearly visible

4. **Visual Polish**
   - [x] Consistent spacing and padding
   - [x] Smooth transitions on interactive elements
   - [x] Icons match Font Awesome 6.4.0 style
   - [x] Color palette matches app theme
   - [x] Rounded corners (border-radius: 0.5rem)

#### ✅ **Performance Tests**

```javascript
// Computed Property Performance
✓ last30DaysTrend: O(30) iterations = instant
✓ recentActivity: O(7) days max = instant
✓ completedDays: O(n) where n = history length
✓ No memory leaks in computed properties
✓ Reactive updates are efficient
```

#### ✅ **Edge Cases**

```javascript
// First Day Usage
✓ totalDays = 1 (just todayGoal)
✓ completedDays = 0 (not yet completed)
✓ completionRate = 0%
✓ streakMessage = "Start your streak today!"

// No Tasks Completed Yet
✓ All bars in trend are gray (h-2)
✓ Completion rate shows 0%
✓ Recent activity shows "No recent activity"
✓ Streak is 0

// All Tasks Complete for Multiple Days
✓ Streak increases correctly
✓ All bars turn green (h-20)
✓ Completion rate approaches 100%

// Partial Completion Pattern
✓ Mixed green/yellow bars render correctly
✓ Percentages calculate accurately
✓ Recent activity shows yellow icon for partial

// No Data Available
✓ Dashboard doesn't show if goalHistory.length = 0
✓ Graceful fallback when todayGoal is null
```

#### ✅ **Integration Tests**

```javascript
// With Daily Goals System
✓ Dashboard reads from dailyGoalsStore
✓ Updates when completeTaskGoal() called
✓ Updates when uncompleteTaskGoal() called
✓ Reflects streak changes from streak calculator
✓ Reflects selected tasks from settings

// With Contribution Calendar
✓ Dashboard shows before calendar
✓ Both use same data source (dailyGoalsStore)
✓ Consistent color coding (green/yellow/gray)
✓ Consistent date calculations

// With IndexedDB
✓ Data persists after page refresh
✓ Historical data loaded on init
✓ Recent entries appear in activity log
✓ Trend shows correct daily statuses
```
