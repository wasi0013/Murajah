# Streak Calculation Fix - Complete Documentation

## Problem Summary

**Scenario**: 
- Oct 23 (Yesterday): User completed ALL goals → streak = 1
- Oct 24 (Today): Page loads, today's goals not started → streak showed 0 (BUG!)
- Oct 24 (Today): User completes ALL today's goals → streak jumped to 2

**Root Cause**: The old `calculateStreak()` function was checking if **at least one selected task** was complete, rather than checking if **ALL tasks** were complete.

---

## The Fix Applied

### File Changed
`/Volumes/Main/personal_projects/Murajah/source/resources/js/utils/dailyGoalsManager.js`

### Key Changes in `calculateStreak()` Function

#### 1. **New Helper Function**: `isGoalComplete()`
```javascript
const isGoalComplete = (dayGoal) => {
  const tasks = Object.values(dayGoal.tasks);
  if (tasks.length === 0) return false;
  
  // ALL tasks must be complete
  const allComplete = tasks.every(task => task.completed === true);
  return allComplete;
};
```

**Why**: Checks that **every single task** in a goal is marked complete, not just some.

#### 2. **Correct Streak Logic**: Check ALL tasks, not selected tasks
**Before (WRONG)**:
```javascript
const tasksCompleted = Object.entries(dayGoal.tasks)
  .filter(([taskName, task]) => {
    return selectedTasks.includes(taskName) && task.completed;
  }).length;
if (tasksCompleted > 0) currentStreak++; // ❌ WRONG: at least 1
```

**After (CORRECT)**:
```javascript
const goalComplete = isGoalComplete(dayGoal);
if (goalComplete) {
  currentStreak++;
  // ✅ CORRECT: ALL tasks must be complete
}
```

#### 3. **Improved Continuity Check**
**Critical Logic**:
```javascript
// Streak continues ONLY if:
// 1. Last completed day is yesterday (streak continues to today even if today incomplete)
// 2. Last completed day is today (all tasks done today)
// Otherwise → gap detected → streak broken to 0

if (!isYesterday && !isToday) {
  // More than 1 day gap → streak breaks
  currentStreak = 0;
} else if (isYesterday || isToday) {
  // No gap → streak continues
}
```

## How It Works Now

### Scenario 1: Incomplete Today (Expected Behavior)
```
History:
  Oct 21: ✅ All complete
  Oct 22: ✅ All complete  
  Oct 23: ✅ All complete
  Oct 24: ⏳ No tasks started

Result:
  currentStreak = 3 (from Oct 21-23)
  ✅ CORRECT: Yesterday (Oct 23) complete → streak continues
```

### Scenario 2: Completed Today (Expected Behavior)
```
History:
  Oct 21: ✅ All complete
  Oct 22: ✅ All complete
  Oct 23: ✅ All complete
  Oct 24: ✅ All complete (just completed)

Result:
  currentStreak = 4 (from Oct 21-24)
  ✅ CORRECT: All consecutive days complete
```

### Scenario 3: Broken Streak (Expected Behavior)
```
History:
  Oct 21: ✅ All complete
  Oct 22: ❌ Only 1 of 3 complete
  Oct 23: ✅ All complete
  Oct 24: ✅ All complete

Result:
  currentStreak = 2 (only from Oct 23-24)
  ✅ CORRECT: Oct 22 incomplete → streak broken there
```

## Debug Statements Added

The function now logs:

1. **Entry Point**:
   ```
   [calculateStreak] CALLED with:
   [calculateStreak]   - dailyGoalHistory length: X
   [calculateStreak]   - Dates in history: 2025-10-21, 2025-10-22, ...
   ```

2. **For Each Day**:
   ```
   [calculateStreak] Processing 2025-10-23:
   [calculateStreak]   - Task names: recordRandomPage, reviewRange, memorizeDaily
   [calculateStreak]     - Total tasks: 3, All complete: true
   [calculateStreak] 2025-10-23 - ALL TASKS COMPLETE: currentStreak = 1
   ```

3. **Continuity Check**:
   ```
   [calculateStreak] Checking continuity:
   [calculateStreak]   - Last complete date: 2025-10-23
   [calculateStreak]   - Yesterday: 2025-10-23
   [calculateStreak]   - Today: 2025-10-24
   [calculateStreak]   - isYesterday: true, isToday: false
   [calculateStreak]   - currentStreak before continuity check: 1
   [calculateStreak] STREAK CONTINUES: Yesterday was complete, streak remains 1
   ```

4. **Final Result**:
   ```
   [calculateStreak] FINAL RESULT: currentStreak=1, longestStreak=1
   ```

## Expected Test Results

### Test 1: Load on New Day
**Setup**: Oct 23 goals all complete (saved). Reload on Oct 24.

**Expected**: 
- Console shows: `currentStreak = 1`
- Streak badge displays: **1** (not 0 ✓)

**Verify**: 
```
[calculateStreak] Processing 2025-10-23:
[calculateStreak]     - Total tasks: 3, All complete: true
[calculateStreak] 2025-10-23 - ALL TASKS COMPLETE: currentStreak = 1
[calculateStreak] Checking continuity:
[calculateStreak]   - isYesterday: true
[calculateStreak] STREAK CONTINUES: Yesterday was complete, streak remains 1
[calculateStreak] FINAL RESULT: currentStreak=1, longestStreak=1
```

### Test 2: Complete Today's Goals
**Setup**: Streak showing 1. User completes all today's goals.

**Expected**: 
- Streak badge jumps to: **2** (not from 0 to 2 ✓)

**Verify**:
```
[calculateStreak] Processing 2025-10-24:
[calculateStreak]     - Total tasks: 3, All complete: true
[calculateStreak] 2025-10-24 - ALL TASKS COMPLETE: currentStreak = 2
[calculateStreak] FINAL RESULT: currentStreak=2, longestStreak=2
```

### Test 3: Partial Completion Breaks Streak
**Setup**: Oct 22 has only 1/3 tasks complete. Oct 23 all complete. Load Oct 24.

**Expected**: 
- Streak badge shows: **1** (only Oct 23)
- Breaks correctly at Oct 22

**Verify**:
```
[calculateStreak] Processing 2025-10-22:
[calculateStreak]     - Total tasks: 3, All complete: false
[calculateStreak] 2025-10-22 - NOT ALL TASKS COMPLETE: Streak broken!
[calculateStreak] FINAL RESULT: currentStreak=1, longestStreak=1
```

## Summary

✅ **Fixed**: Streak now correctly counts consecutive days with **ALL tasks complete**
✅ **Fixed**: Streak no longer shows 0 on new day when yesterday was complete
✅ **Fixed**: Streak doesn't jump from 0 to 2 anymore, shows correct progression
✅ **Added**: Comprehensive debug logging to trace streak calculation

**The logic is now**:
- Count complete days consecutively
- A day is complete only if **ALL** tasks are marked complete
- Check if yesterday was complete to determine if streak continues
- If yesterday incomplete or gap > 1 day → streak resets to 0
