### Lessons Learned

1. **Performance First**
   - Build optimizations in from start
   - Profile continuously
   - Identify bottlenecks early

2. **Modular Architecture**
   - Stores independent
   - Components focused
   - Utilities pure
   - Easier to test and maintain

3. **Mobile-First Approach**
