## 🎨 Key Decisions Already Made

### Technology Stack (Recommended)
| Technology | Why | Already Using? |
|------------|-----|-----------------|
| Vue 3 | Component framework | ✅ Yes (quiz.html) |
| Tailwind CSS | Responsive styling | ✅ Yes (quiz.html) |
| IndexedDB | Structured storage | ✅ Available |
| Composition API | State management | ✅ Modern approach |

### Design Approach (Recommended)
- **Mobile-First:** Start with 320px, enhance upward
- **Component-Based:** 8+ Vue components
- **Modular Stores:** 6 centralized state stores
- **Responsive Grids:** CSS Grid + Flexbox with Tailwind

### Data Strategy (Recommended)
- **Storage:** IndexedDB (1GB) instead of localStorage (5MB)
