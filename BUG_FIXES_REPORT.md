**Total Bugs Fixed**: 6 major bugs
**File**: `/Volumes/Main/personal_projects/Murajah/source/beta-full.html`

## Summary

Before launch, we identified and fixed **6 critical bugs** that would have impacted user experience and data integrity. All fixes have been applied and tested.

---

## Bug #1: Tajweed Font Toggle Doesn't Apply ✅ FIXED

### Problem
The "Enable Tajweed Colors" checkbox in Settings didn't actually change the fonts displayed. The setting was stored but not applied to the font rendering.

### Root Cause
The `loadPageFont()` function was checking `localStorage.getItem('tajweed')` directly instead of using the reactive `settingsStore.tajweedEnabled` value. Additionally, there was no watch function to reload fonts when the setting changed.

### Solution
1. Updated `loadPageFont()` to use `settingsStore.tajweedEnabled` instead of localStorage
2. Added a watch function that reloads the font whenever the tajweed setting changes
3. Updated console logging to show which font is loaded

### Code Changes
```javascript
// BEFORE: Was checking localStorage directly
const tajweed = localStorage.getItem('tajweed') !== 'false' ? true : false;

// AFTER: Uses reactive settingsStore
const tajweed = settingsStore.tajweedEnabled;

// ADDED: Watch for setting changes
watch(() => settingsStore.tajweedEnabled, () => {
  loadPageFont(appStore.currentPage);
  console.log('[Murajah] Tajweed setting changed, font reloaded');
});
```

Lines 1368-1392 (loadPageFont function and new watch)

## Bug #2: Mistakes Not Persisted to localStorage ✅ FIXED

### Problem
When users marked words as mistakes on a page and refreshed the browser, all the mistake data was lost. The `saveData()` function wasn't saving the mistakes Map.

### Root Cause
The `saveData()` function was missing the mistakes data structure entirely. It was only saving: memorized pages, perfect revisions, recordings, and settings - but NOT mistakes.

### Solution
Added mistakes serialization to the saveData function:
- Convert Map<pageNum, Set<wordIds>> to Object format for JSON storage
- Each mistake entry becomes: { pageNum: [wordId1, wordId2, ...] }

### Code Changes
```javascript
// BEFORE: Missing mistakes data
const data = {
  memorized: Array.from(memorizedStore.memorizedPages),
  perfectRevisions: Object.fromEntries(perfectRevisionsStore.perfectRevisions),
  recordings: audioStore.recordings,
  settings: settingsStore,
  lastSaved: new Date().toISOString()
};

// AFTER: Now includes mistakes
const data = {
  memorized: Array.from(memorizedStore.memorizedPages),
  perfectRevisions: Object.fromEntries(perfectRevisionsStore.perfectRevisions),
  mistakes: Object.fromEntries(
    Array.from(mistakesStore.mistakes).map(([key, val]) => [key, Array.from(val)])
  ),
  recordings: audioStore.recordings,
  settings: settingsStore,
  lastSaved: new Date().toISOString()
};
```

## Bug #3: Mistakes Not Restored from localStorage ✅ FIXED

### Problem
Even if we fixed saveData(), the loadStoredData() function wasn't restoring mistakes from localStorage. Users would lose all mistake tracking on app reload.

### Root Cause
The `loadStoredData()` function was only restoring: memorized pages, perfect revisions, and recordings. It was missing mistakes and settings restoration.

### Solution
1. Added mistakes restoration with proper Map/Set conversion
2. Added settings restoration so user preferences persist
3. Properly converts JSON array format back to Map<Set> structure

### Code Changes
```javascript
// BEFORE: Missing mistakes and settings
if (data.memorized) memorizedStore.memorizedPages = new Set(data.memorized);
if (data.perfectRevisions) {
  perfectRevisionsStore.perfectRevisions = new Map(...);
}
if (data.recordings) audioStore.recordings = data.recordings;

// AFTER: Now restores mistakes and settings
if (data.memorized) memorizedStore.memorizedPages = new Set(data.memorized);
if (data.perfectRevisions) {
  perfectRevisionsStore.perfectRevisions = new Map(...);
}
if (data.mistakes) {
  mistakesStore.mistakes = new Map(
    Object.entries(data.mistakes).map(([k, v]) => [parseInt(k), new Set(v)])
  );
}
if (data.recordings) audioStore.recordings = data.recordings;
if (data.settings) Object.assign(settingsStore, data.settings);
```

## Bug #4: Clicking Words Doesn't Mark Mistakes ✅ FIXED

### Problem
When users clicked on words in the Quran text to mark them as mistakes, nothing happened. The words weren't being added to the mistakes tracking.

### Root Cause
The `highlightWord()` function was just toggling a `selectedWords` Set for UI display but was NOT actually adding words to the `mistakesStore.mistakes` Map.

### Solution
Completely rewrote the highlightWord function to:
1. Create a mistakes Set for the current page if it doesn't exist
2. Toggle the word ID in the page's mistakes Set
3. Call saveData() to persist the changes
4. Provide console logging for debugging

### Code Changes
```javascript
// BEFORE: Only toggling selection, not saving mistakes
const highlightWord = (word) => {
  if (selectedWords.value.has(word.id)) {
    selectedWords.value.delete(word.id);
  } else {
    selectedWords.value.add(word.id);
  }
  console.log(`[Murajah] Word ${word.id} selected - Total: ${selectedWords.value.size}`);
};

// AFTER: Actually saves mistakes to store
const highlightWord = (word) => {
  // Add/remove word from mistakes for current page
  if (!mistakesStore.mistakes.has(appStore.currentPage)) {
    mistakesStore.mistakes.set(appStore.currentPage, new Set());
  }
  
  const pageErrors = mistakesStore.mistakes.get(appStore.currentPage);
  
  if (pageErrors.has(word.id)) {
    pageErrors.delete(word.id);
  } else {
    pageErrors.add(word.id);
  }
  
  // Save after updating
  saveData();
  console.log(`[Murajah] Word ${word.id} mistake toggled on page ${appStore.currentPage}`);
};
```

## Bug #5: Mistake Words Not Visually Indicated ✅ FIXED

### Problem
Even if mistakes were saved, when users returned to a page with mistakes, the mistake words weren't highlighted in red. There was no visual feedback.

### Root Cause
The word span elements in the template didn't have a class binding for the mistake status. They only had a hover effect but no persistent mistake styling.

### Solution
Added a class binding to check if the word is in the current page's mistakes and apply red background color if it is.

### Code Changes
```html
<!-- BEFORE: No mistake class -->
<span 
  :class="{
    'bg-blue-100 dark:bg-blue-900 rounded-md px-2 py-1': hoveredWordId === word.id,
    'cursor-pointer transition-all duration-200': true
  }"
  ...
>
  {{ word.text }}
</span>

<!-- AFTER: Includes mistake styling -->
<span 
  :class="{
    'bg-blue-100 dark:bg-blue-900 rounded-md px-2 py-1': hoveredWordId === word.id,
    'bg-red-200 dark:bg-red-900': currentPageMistakes.includes(word.id),
    'cursor-pointer transition-all duration-200': true
  }"
  ...
>
  {{ word.text }}
</span>
```

## Bug #6: Go to Page Input Silently Fails ✅ FIXED

### Problem
When users entered an invalid page number in the "Go to" input field (e.g., 0, 700, -1, or non-numeric), the app silently ignored it with no feedback. Users had no idea if their input was rejected.

### Root Cause
The `gotoPage()` function only checked if the input was valid but provided no error message when it failed.

### Solution
Added proper validation with user feedback:
1. Check if input is NaN or out of range
2. Show error message if invalid
3. Auto-dismiss error after 2 seconds
4. Only navigate on valid input

### Code Changes
```javascript
// BEFORE: Silent failure
const gotoPage = () => {
  const num = parseInt(gotoInput.value);
  if (num >= 1 && num <= 604) {
    appStore.currentPage = num;
    gotoInput.value = '';
    updateURL();
  }
};

// AFTER: Shows error feedback
const gotoPage = () => {
  const num = parseInt(gotoInput.value);
  if (isNaN(num) || num < 1 || num > 604) {
    appStore.errorMessage = 'Please enter a page number between 1 and 604';
    setTimeout(() => appStore.errorMessage = '', 2000);
    return;
  }
  appStore.currentPage = num;
  gotoInput.value = '';
  updateURL();
};
```
